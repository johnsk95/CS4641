Instructions to run and look through code used in the analysis

https://github.com/johnsk95/CS4641/tree/master/Project3

The link above contains all the code used for this project.
/datasets directory contains the datasets used for each algorithms.
To take a look, open the arff files in WEKA.

breast.ipynb and heart_pr3.ipynb contains code that plots eigenvalue distributions for PCA
and kurtosis for ICA. Open in colab to run code and see the plots.

nn.ipynb is also a colab jupyter notebook file that contains all the results and plots for
Neural Network run on all algorithms.
